Regarding to this Document about how to build MSK client in another VPC:

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/how-goldman-sachs-builds-cross-account-connectivity-to-their-amazon-msk-clusters-with-aws-privatelink/



Since the steps in the doc is a little bit vague, I am writing down my steps below which I hope that helps.

1. Creating a MSK cluster with Kafka version 2.2.1 and both TLS encrypted and plaintext traffic allowed:
arn:aws:kafka:us-east-1:xxxxxxxx:cluster/demo-msk

I created this cluster in VPC A. It should work fine when trying to connect to it from the same VPC as intro below:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/produce-consume.html

2.Create a target group with target type as IP, protocol TCP, port 9094 and port 9092, and in the same VPC A as the MSK cluster.

3.Register the MSK broker as a target by its IP address.

I am using the following command to check my MSK brokers' IP address

----
$dig +short  b-3.demo-msk.xxxxx.c1.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

>10.0.0.132
----

My target group's registered targets looks like below:

----
IP address       |Port |     Zone         |Status        |Status details
10.0.0.132	|9092|	us-east-1a|	healthy
10.0.0.132	|9094|	us-east-1a|	healthy
10.0.1.21	|9092|	us-east-1b|	healthy
10.0.1.21	|9094|	us-east-1b|	healthy
10.0.2.52	|9092|	us-east-1c|	healthy
10.0.2.52	|9094|	us-east-1c|	healthy
-----

4.Create an NLB with a listener of TCP port 9094 and 9092 and forwarding to the target group created in the previous step.
I have also Enabled Cross-Zone Load Balancing feature here.

5.Enable the NLB for the same AZ and subnet as the MSK broker it fronts(in VPC A).

6.Create an endpoint service configuration for each NLB that requires acceptance and grant permissions to the client account so it can create a connection to this endpoint service. 
You can find the "Service name" after you created this endpoint service, this should be like: "com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc"

7.Create an interface endpoint in VPC B wihch the client is in(different VPC). For Service category, choose Find service by name. For Service Name, enter the name of the service (for example, com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc) and choose Verify.

8.Create a Route 53 private hosted zone, with the domain name kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com(in your case, use "kafka.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com" instead), and associate it with the VPC B.

9.Create A-Alias records identical to the broker DNS names to avoid any TLS handshake failures and point it to the interface endpoints of the respective brokers.

e.g:
----
Record name:
b-1.demo-msk.xxxxx.c1.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

Type:
A	

Routing policy:
Simple

Alias:
Yes	

Value/Route traffic to:
vpce-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-us-east-1a.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com.
----

After configured above, I can successfully connect to my MSK cluster in VPC A from my client in VPC B through both port 9092 and 9094:

----
$ telnet b-3.demo-msk.xxxxx.c1.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 9094
Trying 172.31.5.173...
Connected to b-3.demo-msk.xxxxx.c1.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.


$ telnet b-3.demo-msk-2.xxxxx.c1.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 9092
Trying 172.31.5.173...
Connected to b-3.demo-msk.xxxxx.c1.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
